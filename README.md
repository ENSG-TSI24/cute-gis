## Features

### 2D Mode

In 2D mode, CuteGis offers a variety of features to manage and visualize geospatial data:

- Local Data Loading: Supports loading of local data files in formats such as .shp, .geojson, and .tiff.
- Data Streaming: Load data via WMS (Web Map Service) and WFS (Web Feature Service) streams.
- Visualization: Visualize image layers (e.g., orthophotos) and vector layers (e.g., roads, buildings, etc.).
- Camera Control: Simple camera controls including zoom and pan to navigate the map.
- Layer Management: A robust layer management system allowing you to reorder, rename, delete layers, and focus on specific layers.
- Entity Information Display: View entity information in an attribute table and highlight individual elements through mouse interaction.
- Session Management: Save and restore previously loaded layers with the session system, retaining the last state of the application.

### 3D Mode

Unfortunately, CuteGis does not currently support a full 3D mode with all the feature available in 2d mode. In the existing 3D mode, you can:

-  Load .obj files
-  Display them in the view area, and navigate through the view.

## Installing CuteGis

- Clone or download source-code from this repository
```bash
    gh repo clone ENSG-TSI24/cute-gis
```
- Move to the good place
```bash
    cd path/to/cute-gis
```
- Enable Display Access: To render the main window of the application from the docker container, run the following command:

```bash
    xhost +
```
- Finally you can now, build and run the container:
```bash
    docker-compose up
```

## How to use CuteGis

### Load Data Files

You can load data files into the application. Here are some examples:

- **Supported File Formats:**
    - **For 2D:** `.shp`, `.geojson`, `.tiff`.
    - **For 3D:** `.obj`.

- **Steps in 2D Mode:**
    1. Click on the **"File"** button and then **"Open File"** in the user interface.
    2. Two options are available:
        - **Local Data:** Import a file from your file system.
        - **Flux Data:**
            1. Choose the web service URL (only WMS/WFS).
            2. Select the layer to load.
    3. Confirm to display the data on the map.

- **Steps in 3D Mode:**
    1. Click on the **"File"** button and then **"Open File"** in the user interface.
    2. Import a local file in `.obj` format.
    3. Confirm to display the 3D model.

### Navigation and Exploration

- **Interact with the Map:**
    - Use the mouse or touchpad to:
        - **Zoom :** Scroll the mouse wheel(2D) or use the Z and S keys(3D).
        - **Pan:** Click and drag to move the map.
    - You can also use the arrow keys or `ZQSD` to navigate.

- **Explore the Data:**
    - Right-click on layers in the **Layer manager** to display their options.
